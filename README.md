# Legacy Seismic Data

## Background

The Legacy Seismic Data (LSD) project is an outcome of the [2019 Securing Legacy Seismic Data to Enable Future Discoveries Workshop](https://geodynamics.org/cig/events/calendar/2019-seismic-legacy/). Participants of the workshop identified eight community needs to advance workshop goals (Hwang et al., 2020):
* Analog Holdings Catalog. Create an inventory of analog
seismic data holdings to identify current resources, connect
* Publications Database. Create a database of research publications
that use analog data as a resource to other researchers,
inspire new studies, and to demonstrate the need to preserve
these data.
* Metadata Standards. Begin work on creating FAIR compliant
metadata standards to enable federated discovery and access.
* Pilot Project. Identify existing repositories to pilot federated
data search and access utilizing proposed metadata standards,
and retrieval of multiple data and metadata types.
* Future Research. Identify strategies to enable future research
through open source and standardization of both data and software
and targeted campaigns with specific research objectives.
* New Technologies. Identify enabling technologies to reduce
human intervention in the end-to-end process of creating
research-ready, time series data.
* Other Communities. Attract a broader scientific community
to apply seismological data in nontraditional research domains
and communities with similar needs in preserving analog time
series data.
* Outreach. Create a larger community of users through outreach
at all career levels.

## About

This website is an open source community project to make progress on these goals. All contributions are welcomed.
