Weston Observatory is a geophysical research and science education center of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Boston College.
The first Weston Observatory seismographs were installed in 1930 recording its first earthquake in January 1931. The instruments were maintained by the Jesuits at Weston College for many decades. The Observatory became formally affiliated with Boston College in 1947.
