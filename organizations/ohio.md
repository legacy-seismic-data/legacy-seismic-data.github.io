The first Jesuit seismic observatory was established at John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio by Father Frederik L. Odenbach in 1900.  He went on to create a seismic network that spanned across the United States and Canada at different Jesuit institutions. The observatory was closed in 1992 and the records were put into storage at the H.R. Collins Laboratory & Core Repository in 2000. In 1999, the Ohio Seismic Network (Ohio Geological Survey) assumed responsibility for these records.

Currently maintained by the [Ohio Geological Survey](https://ohiodnr.gov/wps/portal/gov/odnr/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/about-ODNR/geologic-survey).

## Data Availability
Digital scanning began on select seismograms in ~2019.

The entire analog collection, >100,000 seismograms, is available to interested researchers. The records are continuous from the early 1920's through 1931.
