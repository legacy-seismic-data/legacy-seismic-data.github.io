The Geophysical Survey of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Michigan State University are working
to recover, preserve, scan, and digitize the historic seismograms of Soviet Peaceful Nuclear Explosions
(PNEs). The Soviet Union detonated 122 PNEs from the mid-1960s through the late 1980s. The PNEs
were conducted in a wide range of geologic settings and geographic locations, thus representing a unique
data set for geophysical studies. T
