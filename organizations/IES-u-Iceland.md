Recording of analog seismic records in Iceland began in 1910 when the first seismograph was installed in Reykjavík. The number of seismic stations increased greatly in the 1970s and reached a maximum in the late 1980s. Digital recording began in 1990 and since 2010, all seismic recordings have been digital.

The project to make historical seismograms from stations in Iceland available in digital form was initiated in 2017 by Sigurður Jakobsson and Páll Einarson, with an inital grant from Eggertssjódur.

The last analog seismograph was taken out of service in 2010.
