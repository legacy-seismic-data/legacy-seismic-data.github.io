The history of seismographic observation in the first half of the twentieth century on
the Chinese mainland can be divided into three eras. The first era was from 1904 to 1929
when there were some seismographic stations that were built in Mainland China by
foreigners. The second era started from 1930 when the stations near Beijing and in
Nanjing were built by the Chinese. Advanced seismographic instruments were purchased
from abroad, including Wiechert instruments with the heaviest pendulum of 17,000 kg.
The development of Chinese seismic observation was disrupted by the Japan invasion
and war in 1937. The third era was during a time of war, from 1937 to 1948. (Wong, 2020)

By the end of 1976, 29 earthquake agencies had established regional seismic networks.
After 1985, 17 telemetered networks were added. (Chai et al, 2020)


## Stations
About 400 stations nationwide.


## Instrumentation
Wiechert  
Galitzin  
Galitzin-Wilip  
Omori  
DD-1, VGK (short period)  
763, DK-1 (intermediate long-period)  
and tiltmeters, fluid meters, strain meters, and geomagnetic and magnetometers.

## Recording Medium
paper  
photosensitive film  
analog tape

## Data Availability
Approximately 13.5 million analog records have been produced in China between 1904 and 2007 with about 9.7 million still in existence. During this period multiple regional agencies operated seismic networks.
About 3.13 million of these records have been scanned (Chai et al., 2020). Scanning efforts continue by individual agencies as well as the Institute of Geophysics of the China Earthquake Administration.

 Efforts are underway to digitize (vectorize) records from intermediate long-period (400,00 records) e.g. DK1 and SK,
 and long-period instruments for M≥5.0 earthquakes in China and M≥6.0 worldwide. These are stored in SEED and SAC formats.

See also Department of Monitor and Prediction in CEA (2005a, b,c) for a CD ROM of selected seismograms, ~540, from Xujiahui, Dalian, Qingdao, Chongqing and Nanjing stations for the time period from 1906 to 1948.

The data of China Analog Seismic Record Rescue Project are currently
archived at the data center of The Second Monitoring and Application
Center (SMAC), and use is constrained by the privacy policy of SMAC
