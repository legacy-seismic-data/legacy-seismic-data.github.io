The earliest seismographic stations in Southern California were installed by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The seven-station network
established in 1929 was transferred to the California Institute of Technology in 1937.
The Caltech Seismological Laboratory operated the SCSN jointly with the US
Geological Survey beginning in the early 1970s. The network grew during this time in
response to the occurrence of large damaging regional earthquakes. Currently, the modern network operates 254 broadband seismographs with an average spacing of ~23 km.

The network has been well documented throughout its operational history.

Data is available through the [Southern California Earthquake Center Data Center](https://scedc.caltech.edu/data/seismograms.html) Data Center.

## Stations

From 1932-1992, the SCSN recorded close to 1000 channels of data from stations primarily in the southern California region in the United States with a few stations in Nevada.

See the [SCECDC](https://scedc.caltech.edu/index.html) website for a complete list of analog stations available in their [archive](https://scedc.caltech.edu/data/station/index.html).



## Instrumentation
Wood-Anderson (WA), Press-Ewing, Benioff, 30-90, 1-90, WWSSN


## Recording Medium
Paper: Light sensitive (30x92cm) and ink

## Data Availability
**California Department of Water Resources**
<br>
The original paper records, ~ 1 million, from 1928-1992 including special collections are currently housed with DWR in West Sacramento, California.

**IRIS DMC**
<br>
Select images (~70,000) from 1926, 1928-1932, 1937-1938 and special collections were scanned by Google in collaboration with UC Santa Cruz in 2009-2010 as part of the Google Books project.
As only a small part of the collection could be scanned, the images sent to Google were prioritized as follows (Brodsky & Kanamori, 2011):
<ol>
<li>
The Special Collection was scanned in its entirety. The Special Collection contains records collected by Caltech seismologists for their study on significant historical events. These records are predominantly from the Pasadena long‐period Press‐Ewing seismometers, but the collection is extremely heterogeneous and includes copies of records from a number of historical sites. </li>
<li>The Southern California Seismic Network short‐period records were scanned with highest priority going to the earliest records. Records that were deemed too brittle to run through the scan apparatus were skipped. </li>
</ol>

More information can be found on the [Seismo Archvies]( http://ds.iris.edu/seismo-archives/projects/) website.

Special collections and records from 1926-1938 can be downloaded from IRIS DMC [spud database](http://ds.iris.edu/seismo-archives/projects/caltech_archive/).

Scanned images from pre-digital analog recordings of M>3.5 southern California earthquakes and several significant teleseisms recorded in Southern California between 1963 and 1992 are available from 5 stations and include Wood-Anderson (WA) records.
