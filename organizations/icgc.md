Catalonia has a long tradition of seismic recording starting early in the 20th Century. The first known seismic station  started in 1905 at Ebre Observatory (EBR) founded by the Jesuits near Tortosa in southern Catalonia. In 1906, the Royal Academy of Sciences of Barcelona installed a second seismic station, still active, at the Fabra Observatory (FBR), near Barcelona. Both keep their
seismograms and a large amount of complementary information such as station notebooks, seismic bulletins, and correspondence.
Small observatories followed soon in Olot (1907) and Girona (1909) which were operational for a few years with only some scarce data having been preserved. An improved seismic network was installed by the regional government in 1985 and a few stations from the Spanish network and academic institutions were also added.


The Catalan seismic network is
presently managed by the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya [(ICGC)](Ihttps://www.icgc.cat/).

Instituto Geográifico Nacional (IGN) has an exhaustive catalog of old seismographs operated at Spanish observatory sites. The catalog describes instruments operating in Spain up to the 1960's which recorded a graphical representation of ground motion.

A catalog card has been created for every seismograph. The information has been organized into 4 blocks:
1. Name of instrument, location of the instrument, origin, and operational period.
2. Physical characteristics of the instrument: component, mass, free period, damping, friction, magnification, type of record, and record speed and pen radius and/or galvanometer free period.
3. Normalized magnification in poles and zeroes.
4. Instrument status.

Catalog is available in pdf from the [IGN](http://www.ign.es/web/ign/portal) web page [ [download] ](http://www.ign.es/web/resources/sismologia/publicaciones//Catalogosismografos.pdf).
