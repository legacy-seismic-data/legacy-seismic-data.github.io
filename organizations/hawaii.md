The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), the first such observatory in
the United States, was founded in 1912  By Thomas A. Jaggar. It was initially funded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory, and the Hawaiian Volcano research Association. HVO has been a Federal Government facility since 1919. The first seismic network in the USGS was installed on Kïlauea in the 1950s.

## Data Availability

More than 400,000 paper and smoke drum seismic records covering nearly 100 years of earthquakes and
volcanic events in Hawai‘i are housed at HVO.
Approximately 30,000 seismic records of large Hawaiian earthquakes, significant eruptive episodes, and teleseismic events have been identified. These include Mauna Loa eruptive sequences and large earthquakes and their subsequent aftershock
sequences.
