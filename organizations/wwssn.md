The World-Wide Standardized Seismographic Network (WWSSN) provided continuous data from approximately 100 stations around the world beginning in 1961 with station ASL. High quality, continuous data were recorded on standardized instrumentation with accurate clocks. Deployment and operation of the WWSSN was initially done by the U.S. Coast and Geodectic Survey (C&GS) and later transferred from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (successor to the administrative agency for C&GS) to the U.S. Geological Survey. Network support was terminated in 1996. Some of the stations remain closed while others have been upgraded with new digital recording equipment.


## Stations

Over 100 stations worldwide beginning in 1961 through 1996.

See Peterson and Hutt (2014) for a list of stations installed.




## Instrumentation
* 3 component, Benioff short‐period sensors
* 3 component, Sprengnether Press‐Ewing long‐period sensors

See Petersen and Hutt (2014).


## Recording Medium
300 x 900 mm paper seismograms photographed to:
*	film chip (70 by 120 mm)
*	Microfiche (24 per sheet)
*	film rolls (35mm)

## Data Availability
Several organizations hold partial or (mostly) complete sets of photographed data:
* Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory: Microfiche through June 1979, film chips: 1962 through June 1978 (complete)
* Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory: film chips (complete)
* Northwestern University: film chips (partial)
* British Geological Survey: film chips (unknown), microfiche from 1978-1990 (complete)

Scans of all available records were completed for 5 high quality reference stations:

**Region** | **Location** | **Code** | **Latitude** | **Longitude** | **Timespan** | **Components**
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
North America | Albuquerque, New Mexico |ALQ | 34.94250 | -106.45750| 1961 - | 3
| College Outpost, Alaska | COL | 64.90000 | -147.79333 | 1964-1982 | 3
| Tucson, Arizona |TUC | 32.30972 |-110.78222 | 1962- | 3
Other | Kipapa, Hawaii | KIP| 21.42333| -158.01500| 1962 - | 3
| San Juan, Puerto Rico | SJG | 18.11167 | -66.15000 | 1964- | 3

In addition, a large number of scans were also completed for AFI (Afiamalu, Samoa), ANT (Antofagasta, Chile), BUL (Bulawayo, Zimbabwe), CHG (Chiang Mai, Thailand), KON (Kongsberg, Norway), NAI (Nairobi, Kenya), and SPA (South Pole, Antarctica).

It has been estimated that over 400 events were capture on these scans with:
* 153 earthquakes of M&ge;6
* 156 nuclear events


A total of 189,180 scans have been sent to IRC DMC. These contain approximately:
*	26,824 records scanned at 3200 ppi equivalent to 394 dpi (full size 300x900mm seismogram)
*	~11,000 records, one-bit bitonal scanned at 400ppi
*	~150,000 records, 8-bit grayscale scanned at 3200 ppi



See Supplement to Alejandro et al. (2018) for complete list of  M&ge;6 events and list of stations and number of scans available.

For some stations, original paper records maybe available.
