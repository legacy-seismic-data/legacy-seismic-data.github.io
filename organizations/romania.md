Geophysical research in Romania began at the end of the 19th century and grew through the initiative of dedicated researchers in the field of astronomy, geosciences, mathematics and physics.  In 1901, the Romanian Seismological Service was established and 2 stations installed in Bucharest and Timisoara in 1902. The network grew to 6 stations by 1952. Nowadays, the Romanian Seismic Network has over 200 stations both in Romania and in neighboring countries, fully equipped with digital instruments.

The modern Romanian Seismic Network is run by [National Institute of Earth Physics](http://www.infp.ro/).

*Select partial records with observable earthquake signals maybe available at higher resolution and/or have been vectorized using Teseo2 into SAC format.

The database is linked with the [EuroSeismos Database](http://storing.ingv.it/es_web/).

The database (plans to) include(s):
* [seismic bulletins](http://archive.infp.ro/buletine.php) from 1937-1954
* publications
* historical references to the earthquakes
* seismic instruments characterizations

More information about the archive can be found on their [website](http://archive.infp.ro).
