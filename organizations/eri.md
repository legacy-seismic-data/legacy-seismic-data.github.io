The Earthquake Research Institute (ERI) of the University of Tokyo has archived analog seismograms recorded on mechanical seismographs operated by ERI and its predecessors between 1881 and 1993. The first observation started in 1880 by J. A. Ewing at
Hitotsubashi (Tokyo Imperial University) and continued until 1923. ERI was established in 1925. Seismograms were recorded at various buildings of the University of Tokyo, Tsukuba Observatory, and Wakayama seismological network. The collection includes maregrams and seismograms from a a few foreign networks - Taiwan, [Canada](../organizations/canada), and [WWSSN](../organizations/wwssn).


## Stations
Only select records from the Wakayama Microearthquake Network have been scanned.

See Satake et al. (2020) for a list of stations with curated microfilm records from the University of Tokyo, Tsukuba Observatory, Wakayama Seismological Network, and other locations.

### Wakayama Microearthquake Network
The Wakayama microearthquake observatory was established in 1964 at ERI as a network of 10 high‐gain electromagnetic seismographs targeting microearthquakes:

 * T=1s, V=12,000–18,000
 * pen recording on paper at 4mm/s

## Data Availability

### Microfilm
In addition to the original analog seismograms, ERI maintains extensive archives of microfilm data.

**ERI**  
Additional information about the microfilmed seismogram archives at the ERI can be obtained from the
[Historical Seismogram Search System](http://wwweic.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/susu/index_en.html).

**Foreign Seismograms**  
Access the list (station and date) of foreign seismograms available for:
  * [Taiwan](http://wwweic.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/record-W/taiwan-e.html). Includes station reports, meteorological data, seismic bulletins, an earthquake reports.
  * [Canada](http://wwweic.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/canadaseis/canada.html) *availability unconfirmed*. See also [Canada](../organizations/canada).
  * [WWSSN](http://wwweic.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wwssn/filmlist.html). See also [WWSSN](../organizations/wwssn)

### Scanned Images
Images are available for some stations in the Wakayama Microearthquake Network (see list above). This is an ongoing project.

### Vectorized Data
A database of digitized historical records and seismogram images for major earthquakes (~35) from 1920-1949 has been constructed. Plans are to make the data available via the [National Museum of Nature and Science](http://www.kahaku.go.jp/) and [ERI](http://www.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) (Murotani et al., 2020).

Earthquakes digitized include:
 * 1923 Kanto
 * 1944 Tonankai
 * 1946 Nankai
