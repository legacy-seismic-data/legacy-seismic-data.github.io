The following is a list of freely available software available to the community for the vectorization of seismograms from an image.

### DigitSeis
DigitSeis is a software written in MATLAB that converts digital, raster images of analog seismograms to readily usable, discretized time series using image processing algorithms. It runs both on Mac and Windows, and does not require MATLAB installation. *Harvard University*<br>

### SKATE
SKATE (Seismogram Kit for Automatic Trace Extraction). SKATE is a web‐based image‐processing program that is hosted on a remote Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Its use requires users only to navigate a browser to our user interface (see Data and Resources) to begin running the program. No software installation nor purchasing of software is required, and client computer requirements are minimal because all computationally intensive processing is done on the remote server. *Retriever Technology* <br>

### Teseo
Teseo2 (**T**urn the **E**ldest **S**eismograms into the
**E**lectronic **O**riginal **O**nes) is a software tool for quick and accurate digitization of seismogram traces from raster files. *INGV*<br>

### Tiitba
An interactive portable multi-platform software developed to vectorize smoked paper seismograms from, but not limited to, Wiechert seismographs. It is completely coded in Python as an open-source Graphical User Interface (GUI). *UNAM*<br>
