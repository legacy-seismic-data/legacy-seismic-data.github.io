The history of seismography in Iceland began in 1909 with the installation of one horizontal
Mainka seismograph in Reykjavík. Following a period of intermittent operation, regular operation was initiated
in 1925 with the establishment of the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The number of stations increased
gradually over the following decades, and in the sixties, four stations were in operation. The number of permanent
stations proliferated following the Heimaey eruption in 1973 and during most of the eighties the number
of stations was 40–50. The first digital seismograph stations were installed in 1990 and the analog seismic
network was gradually replaced by digital stations over the next two decades. Since 2010, all seismic recordings have been digital.

The project to make historical seismograms from stations in Iceland available in digital form was initiated in 2017 by Sigurður Jakobsson and Páll Einarson, with an inital grant from Eggertssjódur.

## Stations
56 stations in Iceland beginning in 1910 and ending in 2010.

## Instrumentation
1909-1914, 1925-1952 Mainka seismograph NS (1909), EW (1913) <br>
1951-1952 Sprengnether SP  
1958 Willmore Z  
1973 Landsnet

Insrumentation is mostly short period for the recording of local earthquakes. The last analog seismograph was taken out of service in 2010.

See also [WWSSN](../organizations/wwssn) for station Akureyri (AKU).


## Recording Medium
smoked paper  
photographic paper  
7 track-tape  
pen and ink

## Data Availability
The total number of seismograms are estimated to be around 300,000. High-resolution
files are on the order of 4–8 Mb each.


Image files of analog seismograms from 1910-2010 are stored on a server at the Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Iceland, and are made available to the public through their [webpage](http://seismis.hi.is/). The original seismograms are stored in the Icelandic National Archives.
