The Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL) was established in 1961 as a quiet site for testing seismometers for the WWSSN. Over the years, the ASL has been the installation, maintenance and data center for various global seismic networks including the World-Wide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) from 1961 to 1996, the High Gain Long Period (HGLP) network, the Seismic Research Observatories (SRO), the Digital version of the WWSSN (DWWSSN), and the Modified High Gain Long Period network. Approximately 3.7 million single-day record film chips (1962-1978) created from station records (paper seismograms) are maintained at ASL and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

Described below are stations with digital images in addition to those listed under [WWSSN](../organizations/wwssn).
## Stations

Includes stations from the SRO and HGLP amongst other records.
